# LLM and Societal Consequences of AI - Lab

This repository contains the boilerplate code and exercises of the lab session of the
course "Large Language Models and Societal Consequences of Artificial Intelligence"
(1RT730) at the University of Uppsala.

Feel free to look and try these exercises before-hand, attending the lab is optional and
is allocated to help students with problems or questions.

The goal of the lab sessions is to provide hands-on experience with the tools and
methods necessary to build an AI chatbot using pretrained models locally or in the
cloud.

There are two main parts to the lab sessions:
1. Getting acquainted with the AI models API, it has two path (choose one):
   a. Using Google's Gemini API in the cloud (recommended).
   b. Using the Huggingface API on your machine (requires a decent hardware setup).
2. Building a chatbot using the results from the previous step. The chatbot is a
   mushroom expert that can answer questions about mushrooms, and work with images.
